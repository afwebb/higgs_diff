# higgs_diff

Files for ttH differential measurement.

Includes machine learning scripts for predicting the Pt of the higgs in ttH dilepton events.

Current efforts:
- Use xgboost BDT as a cross-check for the nn
- H2O NN for grid training of parameters, easy to use neural net
- Pytorch as nominal NN, mostly in jupyter notebooks
